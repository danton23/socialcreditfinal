	<p> Major Douglas was not the first to radically critique the monetary system and the basic assumptions upon which the modern 'capitalist' economic system functions, but he was, arguably, the first to turn such critiscisms into a major political movement - Social Credit - which had a major influence all across
     the then British Empire and even further afield in countries like (add) 	</p>
	 <p> according to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._H._Douglas"> Wikipedia </a> : It was while he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.

Troubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry ("delivery of goods and services", in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system. " </p>
	 <p> Major Douglas went on to formulate an economic theory, known as Social Credit theory, which took account of ....and argued
	 that, just like an indididual who had invested in a profitable enterprise, members of society as a whole were due some return on 
	 what he termed the 'national dividend' that is the pot of capital in the form of intellectual acheivment ....which had been created by their
	 ancestors as a body and which was therefore owed to everybody in common </p>
	 <p> Much like today, Douglas was living during a time of enormous economic turmoil, in which the standard theories of the academic eonomists and financiers were being increasingly called
	 into question </p>
